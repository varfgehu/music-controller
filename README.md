# Music controller
The web app is based on the following tutorial:
[Django & React - Full Stack Web App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j)
I followed all 17 episodes to complete the application in a code-along style.
It was fun, I really recommend doing it! 

In this django and react tutorial I was using python and javascript to create a full stack web app. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use react and django together to develop a full stack web application. Specifically I created a collaborative music playing app in which is integrated in the application with the third party Spotify API.


### Make sure to define CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET for Spotify API!
